# Vault Keeper - User Guide

> **The problem:** You know what you should do. You set goals. You journal. You track metrics. But somehow, weeks pass and Priority #1 hasn't moved. You're "busy" but not progressing.

> **The reason:** There's a gap between what you say matters and what you actually do. And without consistent, data-driven accountability, that gap stays invisible.

> **The solution:** A Vault Keeper - an AI agent that reads your notes, tracks your patterns, and calls you out when your actions don't match your stated priorities.

## What is a Vault Keeper?

A **Vault Keeper** is an AI accountability system that lives inside your Obsidian vault. It:
- Reads your daily journal entries
- Tracks your metrics over time
- Identifies drift patterns (when you say you'll do X but consistently do Y)
- Connects your behaviors to outcomes (e.g., "You hit your goals 80% of days when you sleep 7+ hours")
- Holds you accountable using your own words back to you

**It's NOT:**
- A passive note-taking assistant that organizes files
- A generic motivational chatbot that says "you got this!"
- Something that does the work for you

**It IS:**
- Your pattern recognition engine
- Your data-driven mirror (shows reality vs. your story)
- Your accountability partner that can't be manipulated or fooled
- A system that gets more valuable the more data you give it

---

## Who This Is For

**This system works best if you:**
- Already journal or are willing to start (5 min/day minimum)
- Use Obsidian (or a markdown-based note system)
- Have specific goals but struggle with consistency
- Want accountability without judgment
- Are willing to see uncomfortable truths about your behavior
- Prefer data over feelings when evaluating progress

**This system is NOT for you if:**
- You want someone to tell you what to do (it reflects, doesn't direct)
- You're not willing to track honestly (garbage in, garbage out)
- You expect the AI to do the work for you
- You want validation more than you want results

---

## How It Works (The Core Loop)

```
1. You journal daily (5-10 min)
   ↓
2. Agent reads your entries + tracks metrics
   ↓
3. Agent identifies patterns
   ↓
4. Agent generates accountability brief
   ↓
5. You see the gap between words and actions
   ↓
6. You adjust behavior (or justify why you're not - also data)
   ↓
7. Repeat daily/weekly
```

**Over time:**
- Patterns become undeniable
- Self-sabotage cycles get named and exposed
- Data correlations emerge (what actually works for YOU)
- Accountability becomes automatic
- Progress becomes measurable

## Real Examples (Anonymized)

**Student:** "I said I'd study 3 hours/day. I'm averaging 45 minutes. But I've scrolled social media for 2+ hours every day. The constraint isn't time - it's choice."

**Entrepreneur:** "I've spent 40 hours this week 'working' but shipped zero features. All the hours were meetings, planning, and 'research.' This is busy work, not Priority #1."

**Creative:** "I've written '30-day content challenge' in my goals for 3 months. I'm on Day 2. This is the 4th time I've restarted. The pattern: I go hard for 2 days, then disappear for 2 weeks."

**Fitness:** "Sleep <6 hours: 30% workout completion. Sleep 7+ hours: 90% workout completion. The constraint isn't motivation - it's sleep."

---

## What Makes This Different?

**vs. Habit trackers:** Those show IF you did something. This shows WHY you didn't (patterns, correlations, blocking behaviors).

**vs. Journaling alone:** You can lie to yourself in a journal. The agent reads across ALL entries and calls out contradictions.

**vs. Human accountability partners:** Humans get tired of calling you out. Humans can be manipulated. Humans have their own biases. The agent doesn't.

**vs. Generic AI assistants:** Most AI just answers questions or organizes info. This one actively monitors, identifies patterns, and initiates accountability conversations.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Tracking too many metrics** - Start with 3-5 key ones
2. **Hiding failures** - The agent needs to see when you fail to help you
3. **Not defining success clearly** - "Be better" isn't measurable; "Exercise 4x/week" is
4. **Ignoring the uncomfortable feedback** - The agent's job is to call you out
5. **Asking for tool optimization instead of doing the work** - Classic avoidance pattern

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The agent isn't holding me accountable"
- **Likely cause:** You haven't been specific enough about your priorities
- **Fix:** Explicitly state "My Priority #1 is X. If I'm not doing X, call me out."

### "I'm not filling out the journal consistently"
- **Likely cause:** Template is too complex
- **Fix:** Simplify to 5 fields max. You can always add more later.

### "The agent's feedback feels generic"
- **Likely cause:** Not enough data in your vault yet
- **Fix:** Journal for 1 week minimum so patterns emerge

### "I feel judged by the agent"
- **Reframe:** The agent is showing you what you're already doing. If it feels judgmental, that's data - you're judging yourself.
- **Remember:** The agent has no emotion. It's a mirror.

### "The system isn't working"
- **Ask yourself:** Am I tracking honestly? Am I ignoring the feedback? Am I expecting the agent to do the work for me?
- **Reality check:** The agent shows patterns. You have to change behavior.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need Claude Code or can I use regular Claude?**
A: Either works. Claude Code is better if you want it to automatically read your vault daily. Regular Claude with file upload works too but requires manual uploads.

**Q: How long does journaling take?**
A: 5-10 minutes per day once you're in a rhythm. Week 1 might take 15 minutes as you figure out the template.

**Q: What if I miss a day?**
A: That's fine. The agent will track the gap and identify if "missing days" becomes a pattern. Missing one day isn't the problem - missing the same day every week (like Sundays) reveals a pattern.

**Q: Can I change my priorities mid-stream?**
A: Yes. Just tell Claude "My priorities have changed. Here's my new stack: ..." and it will adapt.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: This runs locally in your Obsidian vault. Claude reads your files during your session but doesn't store them permanently. Standard Claude privacy policies apply.

**Q: Can I share my vault with an accountability partner?**
A: Yes! You can both journal in the same vault and Claude can generate comparative analysis.
