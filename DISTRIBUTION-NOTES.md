## How Users Set It Up

### Their Experience (5 minutes total):

1. **Download this entire folder** to their Obsidian vault root
2. **Open Claude** and say: *"Read 'Vault-Keeper-System/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md' and run the setup wizard"*
3. **Answer 8 questions** (Claude asks them interactively):
   - Name
   - Focus area (Academic/Business/Creative/Fitness/Career/Spiritual)
   - Priority #1, #2, #3
   - Main struggle pattern
   - Success metric
   - Vault structure preference
4. **Claude automatically creates everything:**
   - Folder structure (Journal/Daily/, Goals/, Templates/)
   - Custom journal template (based on their focus area)
   - Priority Stack document
   - First journal entry
   - System reference document
5. **System is live** - they start journaling

**That's it. No manual setup. No confusion.**

## Marketing Angles

### Problem → Solution
"You know what you should do. You set goals. You journal. But weeks pass and nothing moves. Why? There's a gap between what you say matters and what you actually do. Vault Keeper makes that gap impossible to ignore."

### Differentiation
- **vs. Habit trackers:** Shows WHY you didn't, not just IF
- **vs. Journaling:** Can't lie to pattern recognition
- **vs. Human accountability:** Never gets tired, biased, or manipulated
- **vs. Generic AI:** Actively monitors and initiates accountability

### Social Proof Angles
- "The AI that won't let you lie to yourself"
- "Accountability you can't escape"
- "Your data, your words, your patterns - impossible to ignore"
- "What if you couldn't avoid seeing your own drift?"

---

## Target Audiences

### Primary:
- **Students** struggling with consistency
- **Entrepreneurs** drowning in busy work
- **Creators** consuming more than creating
- **Anyone** with goals but no follow-through

### Secondary:
- Coaches (use with clients)
- Accountability groups
- Productivity communities
- Self-improvement enthusiasts
