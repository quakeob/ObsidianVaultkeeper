## What is This?

**Vault Keeper** is an AI-powered accountability system that lives in your Obsidian vault. It reads your daily journal, tracks your patterns, and holds you accountable to what you say matters most.

**It's NOT:**
- A note organizer
- A motivational chatbot
- Something that does work for you

**It IS:**
- A pattern recognition engine
- A data-driven accountability mirror
- A system that gets smarter the more you use it

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Download This Folder
Save the entire `Vault-Keeper-System` folder to your Obsidian vault root.

### Step 2: Activate the System
1. Open Claude Code (or Claude with file access)
2. Point it to your Obsidian vault
3. Say: **"Read the file 'Vault-Keeper-System/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md' and run the Vault Keeper setup wizard"**

### Step 3: Answer the Questions (Asked One at a Time)
Claude will ask you 10 questions in conversational chunks:
- Your name and focus area
- Your priorities (what matters most?)
- Your success metrics (how do you measure progress?)
- Your main struggle (what pattern are you fighting?)
- Your accountability style (how should Claude call you out?)
- Weekly review preferences (automatic or manual?)

### Step 4: Claude Builds Everything
Automatically creates:
- Your custom journal template (based on focus area)
- All necessary folders (Journal, Goals, Pattern Library)
- Your Priority Stack document
- Your first journal entry
- Adaptive Pattern Engine

**That's it. System is live.**

## What Happens Next

**Phase 1 (Days 1-7): Baseline Observation**
- Claude watches and learns YOUR unique patterns
- Identifies success conditions, drift signals, correlations
- Builds your behavioral fingerprint
- Light accountability, heavy observation

**Phase 2 (Day 8+): Predictive Accountability**
- Claude predicts drift BEFORE it happens
- Uses your chosen accountability style
- Documents new patterns to Pattern Library
- Weekly reviews (automatic or on-demand)

---

## What's New in v2.0

### 1. Conversational Setup Wizard
Questions asked in chunks (1-2 at a time), not all at once. Less overwhelming, better accuracy.

### 2. Accountability Style Calibration
Choose how Claude holds you accountable:
- **Direct & Blunt** (no softening, pure data gaps)
- **Socratic** (questions that reveal patterns)
- **Supportive but Firm** (acknowledges effort, shows reality)
- **Data-Only** (pure metrics, you interpret)

### 3. Adaptive Pattern Engine
- **Phase 1:** Claude learns YOUR specific patterns (Days 1-7)
- **Phase 2:** Uses patterns to predict drift before it completes (Day 8+)
- **Pattern Library:** Automatically documents discovered patterns

### 4. Weekly Review Automation
Choose to get automatic weekly compilations every Friday/Sunday/Monday, or request manually.

### 5. Pattern Library System
Every unique pattern Claude discovers about you gets documented with:
- Trigger conditions
- Frequency tracking
- Outcome data
- Counter-strategies that work FOR YOU

## What Makes This Different

**vs. Habit trackers:** Shows WHY you didn't, not just IF you did

**vs. Journaling alone:** You can't lie to the pattern recognition

**vs. Human accountability:** Humans get tired. Claude doesn't.

**vs. Generic AI:** This actively monitors and initiates accountability conversations
