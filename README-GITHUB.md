## The Problem

You know what you should do. You set goals. You journal. You track metrics.

But somehow, weeks pass and **Priority #1 hasn't moved.**

You're "busy" but not progressing.

**Why?** There's a gap between what you *say* matters and what you *actually do*.

---

## The Solution

**Vault Keeper** is an AI accountability system that:

- ✅ Reads your daily journal entries
- ✅ Learns YOUR unique behavioral patterns (not generic productivity tips)
- ✅ Predicts drift BEFORE it happens
- ✅ Holds you accountable using your own words and data
- ✅ Gets smarter the more you use it

---

## What Makes This Different?

| vs. Habit Trackers | vs. Journaling Alone | vs. Human Accountability | vs. Generic AI |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Shows **WHY** you didn't, not just IF | Can't lie to pattern recognition | Never gets tired or biased | Actively monitors & initiates conversations |
| Correlates behaviors → outcomes | Quotes your contradictions back | No emotional manipulation | Learns YOUR specific patterns |

## Features

### 🎯 Adaptive Pattern Engine
- **Phase 1 (Days 1-7):** Observes and learns YOUR specific patterns
- **Phase 2 (Day 8+):** Predicts drift before it happens
- **Pattern Library:** Auto-documents every unique pattern discovered

### 💬 Calibrated Accountability Styles
Choose how Claude holds you accountable:
- **Direct & Blunt:** Pure data gaps, no softening
- **Socratic:** Questions that reveal patterns
- **Supportive but Firm:** Acknowledges effort, shows reality
- **Data-Only:** Pure metrics, you interpret

### 📊 Smart Tracking
- 6 pre-built templates (Academic, Business, Creative, Fitness, Career, Spiritual)
- Custom focus areas supported
- Automatic weekly reviews (optional)
- Success/drift pattern correlation

### 🔄 Conversational Setup
- 10 questions asked in chunks (1-2 at a time)
- Automatically builds your custom system
- 5-minute setup, zero configuration

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (free note-taking app)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) or Claude with file access
- 5 minutes for setup
- 5-10 minutes daily for journaling

### Installation

1. **Download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vault-keeper.git
   ```

2. **Copy to your Obsidian vault**
   ```bash
   cp -r vault-keeper /path/to/your/vault/Vault-Keeper-System
   ```

3. **Run setup in Claude**
   Open Claude Code, point it to your vault, and say:
   ```
   Read 'Vault-Keeper-System/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md' and run the setup wizard
   ```

4. **Answer 10 questions** (asked conversationally, 1-2 at a time)

5. **Start journaling** (Claude created your first entry)

**That's it. System is live.**

## How It Works

```
You journal daily (5-10 min)
    ↓
Claude reads your entries
    ↓
Claude identifies YOUR unique patterns
    ↓
Claude predicts drift BEFORE failure
    ↓
You see the gap between words and actions
    ↓
You adjust behavior
    ↓
Progress becomes measurable
```

### Example: Predictive Accountability

```
Day 12 - Pattern Alert

I'm seeing early signals of Pattern #2 (identified in your baseline):
- Sleep dropped to 5.5 hours last night (your drift threshold is <6.5)
- Morning energy: 3/10 (your baseline average: 7/10)
- You wrote 'maybe I'll study later' (avoidance language)

Based on YOUR data:
- Days with these conditions → 15% Priority #1 completion rate
- Your success pattern requires: 7+ hours sleep, morning study session

You're entering the drift pattern. What's the play?
```

## Real Examples (Anonymized)

**Student:** *"I said I'd study 3 hours/day. I'm averaging 45 minutes. But I've scrolled social media for 2+ hours every day. The constraint isn't time - it's choice."*

**Entrepreneur:** *"I've spent 40 hours this week 'working' but shipped zero features. All the hours were meetings, planning, and 'research.' This is busy work, not Priority #1."*

**Fitness:** *"Sleep <6 hours: 30% workout completion. Sleep 7+ hours: 90% workout completion. The constraint isn't motivation - it's sleep."*

## Who This Is For

**This system works best if you:**
- ✅ Already journal or are willing to start (5 min/day)
- ✅ Use Obsidian (or markdown-based notes)
- ✅ Have specific goals but struggle with consistency
- ✅ Want accountability without judgment
- ✅ Prefer data over feelings when evaluating progress
- ✅ Are willing to see uncomfortable truths about your behavior

**This system is NOT for you if:**
- ❌ You want someone to tell you what to do (it reflects, doesn't direct)
- ❌ You're not willing to track honestly (garbage in, garbage out)
- ❌ You expect the AI to do the work for you
- ❌ You want validation more than results
